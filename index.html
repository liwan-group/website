				<h3>Causality Between the Built Environment and Subjective Wellbeing: Applying Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control Methods to Longitudinal Data From England</h3>
				<h4>Jerry Chen</h4>
				<!-- <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> -->
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Causality between the built environment and subjective wellbeing has thus far been segmentally explored and partially quantified. We identify two unresolved challenges in the literature. Firstly, a reliance on cross-sectional data produces associative findings. Secondly, a reductive approach to regress aggregate subjective wellbeing on limited and disparate built environment measurements risks significant confounding effects. We address the research gaps by leveraging residential relocation as a natural experiment to investigate the causality between built environment change and subjective wellbeing. Two causal inference methods (difference-in-differences and synthetic control) are applied and compared. Our research design incorporates novel extensions to the canonical forms of both causal inference methods – staggered difference-in-differences and generalised synthetic control methods – to accommodate individual-level data with multiple relocation timepoints.</p>

				<h3>Complements or Substitues: Greenbelt and Congestion Charge Policy For Post-pandemic City Regions - Insights From A New Spatial Equilibrium Model</h3>
				<h4>Yibin Li</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This research switches the policy assessment from the single city and one policy analysis into a multi-policy city-regional scale assessment by considering the city network, 
					different hierarchical city levels, and policy scenario comparison. The changing preferences for city-center and suburban amenities and the popularity of remote work in the 
					post-pandemic are two new challenges to existing SCGE models. Those two new challenges on existing SCGE models have been considered in this research to model the public location choice and urban spatial structure.</p>

				<h3>Developing a New Spatial Equilibrium Model for quantifying the Energy Impacts of Alternative Urban Spatial Planning Strategies for Fast-growing City Regions: A Case Study of Greater Beijing, China</h3>
				<h4>Qiancheng Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This study builds on the activity-based approach in transport modelling and expands it as a unified analytical framework for quantifying the effects of the land-use and transport planning on long-term city-scale energy intensity in fast-growing city regions. 
				The new modelling framework features a consistent activity-based choice model linking the building and transport sector, subject to explicit time and budget constraints and spatial equilibrium condition in the housing market. The study demonstrates the policy use of the model through an empirical model application for the Greater Beijing in China and estimates the carbon/energy intensity elasticities with respect to planning policy variables with the base-year model after calibration. The calibrated model will then be used to estimate the emission/energy outlook based on a series of urban spatial development scenarios and to test the magnitude and rate of technological and behavioural change required for achieving local sustainability goals.

				<h3>Examine the Spatial Economic Impact of Singapore’s Ethnicity Integration Policy</h3>
				<h4>Shantong Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The study aims to quantitatively assess the spatial and economic impact of Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) on the development of housing market and urban spatial structure in Singapore. 
				Specifically, two main research questions are proposed. (1) Whether EIP would have an impact on the spatial pattern and time-series changes of housing price in Singapore? If so, how would EIP affect the development of urban spatial structure in Singapore through its impact on the housing market?
				(2) How to mitigate/enhance the negative/positive impact of EIP in relation to the 2030 planning goals in Singapore? 
				The research design includes three main work packages, population synthesis, modelling residential location choice under housing market equilibrium and policy scenario analysis.</p>

				<h3>Using Natural Language Processing to Identify Key Planning Strategies from Government Documents – A Case Study of 117 Chinese Cities from 2011 to 2019</h3>
				<h4>Emily Tianyuan Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Inter-city development disparity is a salient issue for both developed and developing countries. A causal determination of whether and to what extent variations in planning policies lead to different outcomes remains an onerous analytical challenge. 
				Quantitative modelling of such causality requires the identification of a bundle of planning strategies from text-based planning documents in a holistic and temporally consistent manner such that the evolution of development outcomes could be investigated in relation to planning policy changes over time. 
				Enabled by recent progress in natural language processing (NLP), this paper presents a novel NLP application for identifying key planning strategies from a large amount of text-based government documents through a case study of 117 prefecture-level cities in China. 
				Based on official, city-level government reports from 2011 to 2019, the evolving policy strategies are identified and linked with the change of development outcome. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

				<h3>An interdisciplinary method for generating large-scale longitudinal urban expansion data using night-time light data – A case study of 600+ Chinese cities</h3>
				<h4>Zengquan Li</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Night-time light (NTL) data provide a novel and accessible source for monitoring the Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion. The static thresholds ignore the path-dependent nature of urban development. Using NTL data for 2012-2018, this study proposes a new method using dynamic threshold (DT) for extracting UBA using NTL data for 600+ Chinese cities. 
				The dynamic thresholds explicitly address the temporal continuity of urban physical development and further consider intra-city heterogeneity in terms of NTL brightness change pattern. 
				Through a comparison with official statistics in China and UN-Habitat Sentinel-2 Human Settlement data, it is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the DT method exceeds 85%, and the Kappa index exceeds 0.45. </p>

				<h3>Understanding the Implications of Electric Vehicles on Car Dependence and Public Transport - an Inter-Sectoral Approach</h3>
				<h4>Hao Zhang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The Charging Infrastructure (CI) enables large uptakes of Electric Vehicle (EV) for transport decarbonisation. However, the large adoption of EVs may cause congestions. For sustainable mobility, it is timely important to incorporate congestion control when promoting EVs. Smart placement and operation of CIs should be applied to tackle congestion issues by proactively intervening traffic and driving behaviours for the more EV transport system. CI planning should be considered with the public transport while car dependency can be influenced by economic factors such as charging prices. The research question is how adaptive and inter-sectoral EV charging policies may help mitigate car dependence and complement public transport by spatial and technical configuration of CIs and the associated pricing mechanism. Parameters of traffic, parking, demography and public transport will be incorporated with spatial analysis, while the feasibility of employing dynamic and adaptive charging pricing to influence travel behaviour will be explored.</p>

				<h3>The Reshaped Urban Recreational Space in the Digital Era: Trends, Characteristics, and Responses</h3>
				<h4>Enjia Zhang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The growing penetration of ICT has redefined recreational activities and changed the demand, choice, and location of urban recreational services. As the Chinese proverb goes, “fragrant wine would not be restricted by deep alleys,” ICT has alleviated many restrictions imposed by conventional locations on people’s spatial preference for leisure activities, enabling new forms and levels of functional integration. Under the influence of ICT, urban recreational service space has been spreading to the urban suburbs and further penetrating the urban two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces such as residential and office areas. In this context, urban mixed-use development evolves from block scale to the building scale and from ground level to ground above level, resulting in the need for new policies and regulations. Therefore, this study aims to measure the penetration degree of recreational service, identify the characteristics of the built environment elements, and explore urban planning and real estate policy by referring to international case studies. The findings could enhance the theory of mixed-use development and compact city in the digital era, and contribute to policymaking for managing and re-purposing urban spaces, especially for high-density cities.</p>

			<h4>Li Wan and Ilaï Bendavid (2023)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">The lack of information on trip purpose and alternative mode in micromobility service usage data remains a major analytical challenge. Conventional survey method is subject to significant sampling and stated preference biases. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a new inference method through a case study of rental e-scooters in London. The inference method features a rule-based algorithm for matching observed rental e-scooter trips with filtered trip samples in the English National Travel Survey (NTS) series. Probability distribution of trip purposes and alternative modes are then retrieved from NTS. Inference results are validated using official data. Discrepancies, sources of biases and correction measures are investigated. Based on the inferred mode substitution pattern, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions reduction of selected rental e-scooter trips in London (36-103g CO2e per mile). It is expected that the proposed method is applicable to a wide range of micromobility studies using service usage data.</p>

			<h4>Jerry Chen and Li Wan (2023)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Causality between the built environment and subjective wellbeing has thus far been segmentally explored and partially quantified. We identify two unresolved challenges in the literature. Firstly, a reliance on cross-sectional data produces associative findings. Secondly, a reductive approach to regress aggregate subjective wellbeing on limited and disparate built environment measurements risks significant confounding effects. We address the research gaps by leveraging residential relocation as a natural experiment to investigate the causality between built environment change and subjective wellbeing (measured with composite score of negatively phrased General Health Questionnaire-12 items). Two causal inference methods (difference-in-differences and synthetic control) are applied and compared. The use of the ‘Understanding Society’ dataset (The UK Household Longitudinal Study, 2009-2019), combined with holistic locational attributes (Area Classification at the Lower Super Output Area level as per the UK Census) for exploring such causality is novel in literature. Specifically, to estimate the wellbeing effects of residential relocation, we compare movers (treatment n=773) to non-movers (control n=4,619). To estimate the effects of built environment change, we compare movers with a change of built environment type (n=506) to those moving into the same built environment type (n=267). Our research design incorporates novel extensions to the canonical forms of both causal inference methods – staggered difference-in-differences and generalised synthetic control methods – to accommodate individual-level data with multiple relocation timepoints.</p>

			<h4>Jerry Chen and Li Wan (2022)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-pandemic trends. The impact of COVID-19 on the subjective wellbeing of working populations with distinct lifestyles is not yet studied. Methods: Combining time use surveys collected pre- and during COVID-19, latent class analysis was used to identify distinct lifestyles based on aggregated daily activity patterns and reported working modes. We provide qualitative pen portraits alongside pre-versus-during pandemic comparisons of intraday time use and wellbeing patterns. Lifestyle heterogeneity in wellbeing was quantified in relation to aggregated activity types. Results: COVID-19 impact on wellbeing varied significantly between usual working hours (6am-6pm) and rest of the day. The decline in wellbeing outside of usual working hours was significant and consistent across lifestyles. During usual working hours, the direction of impact varied in line with working modes: wellbeing of homeworkers decreased, remained relatively stable for commuters, and increased for certain hybrid workers. Magnitude of impact correlates strongly with lifestyle: those working long and dispersed hours are more sensitive, whereas non-work dominated lifestyles are more resilient. Conclusion: The direction and magnitude of impact from COVID-19 were not uniformly manifested across activity types, time of day, and latent lifestyles. Blurring work-life boundaries and general anxiety about the pandemic may be key determinants of the decline outside of usual working hours. During usual working hours, strong yet complex correlations between wellbeing and time-use changes suggested that policies aiming to enhance wellbeing of workers need to consider not only spatial flexibility but also provide wider support for temporal flexibility.</p>

			<h4>Ling Li and Li Wan (2021)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">This paper studies the spatial impact of COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of intra-city population and house rent changes in Beijing, China. Drawing on multiple geospatial data sets, we find that the pandemic has flattened the housing bid-rent curve in Beijing, which corroborates existing literature mainly based on cities in developed countries. Through regression analysis and spatial equilibrium modelling, we identify key mechanisms of the flattened bid-rent curve and the accompanying decentralisation of residents. First, workplace population change, particularly in central Beijing, seems to be the main factor contributing to the resident population and house rent changes. Second, we find no significant evidence on the spatial impact from remote working, as the share of remote working in Beijing appears low after about one year recovery. This finding contrasts to existing studies where remote working has been perceived as the main driver for urban spatial structure change in a developed country context. Third, through a novel method for quantifying locational preference changes, it is found that the observed decentralisation trend in Beijing, ceteris paribus, may also be associated with increased (decreased) preference for living in suburban (central) locations. However, the preference change for central locations is marginal, hence providing an early rebuttal of the ‘demise of centres’ proposition.</p>

			<h4>Li Wan, Tianyuan Wang, and Helen X. H. Bao (2021)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">The rapid urbanisation in Chinese cities features a distinctive land finance model, where land market, local economy, government revenue, and urban development are intertwined. Quantifying the interdependence between land market and other parts of the social, economic, and political systems has been a challenging undertaking, and the task is further complicated by the great cross-city heterogeneity in natural endowment and local socio-economic conditions. Few existing studies succeeded in capturing both the complexity of the system and the nuance of cross-city variations at the same time. We propose a novel structural equation modelling (SEM) method, integrated with the latent class analysis (LCA), to address this challenge. The LCA is used to identify distinct city groups based on two purposely constructed land-use efficiency measurements. The categorical latent classes of cities are then incorporated in a series of structural equation models, capturing the non-linear heterogeneity across cities. Based on data for 272 prefecture-level Chinese cities between 2012 and 2017, we found quantified evidence on both the direct channel (i.e., one-off revenue from land conveyance fee) and indirect channel (e.g., sustainable tax revenue from the business and employment growth enabled by land development) through which land supply drives urban development. The study also quantifies the significant gap among Chinese cities in terms of land-use efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of developing and implementing reliable land-use efficiency measurements, the need to shift policy focus from one-off income to long-term sustainable revenue, and the potential of lower-tier cities in the next stage of urbanisation in China.</p>
