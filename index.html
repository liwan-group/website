				<h3>Causality Between the Built Environment and Subjective Wellbeing: Applying Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control Methods to Longitudinal Data From England</h3>
				<h4>Jerry Chen</h4>
				<!-- <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> -->
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Causality between the built environment and subjective wellbeing has thus far been segmentally explored and partially quantified. We identify two unresolved challenges in the literature. Firstly, a reliance on cross-sectional data produces associative findings. Secondly, a reductive approach to regress aggregate subjective wellbeing on limited and disparate built environment measurements risks significant confounding effects. We address the research gaps by leveraging residential relocation as a natural experiment to investigate the causality between built environment change and subjective wellbeing. Two causal inference methods (difference-in-differences and synthetic control) are applied and compared. Our research design incorporates novel extensions to the canonical forms of both causal inference methods – staggered difference-in-differences and generalised synthetic control methods – to accommodate individual-level data with multiple relocation timepoints.</p>

				<h3>Complements or Substitues: Greenbelt and Congestion Charge Policy For Post-pandemic City Regions - Insights From A New Spatial Equilibrium Model</h3>
				<h4>Yibin Li</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This research switches the policy assessment from the single city and one policy analysis into a multi-policy city-regional scale assessment by considering the city network, 
					different hierarchical city levels, and policy scenario comparison. The changing preferences for city-center and suburban amenities and the popularity of remote work in the 
					post-pandemic are two new challenges to existing SCGE models. Those two new challenges on existing SCGE models have been considered in this research to model the public location choice and urban spatial structure.</p>

				<h3>Developing a New Spatial Equilibrium Model for quantifying the Energy Impacts of Alternative Urban Spatial Planning Strategies for Fast-growing City Regions: A Case Study of Greater Beijing, China</h3>
				<h4>Qiancheng Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This study builds on the activity-based approach in transport modelling and expands it as a unified analytical framework for quantifying the effects of the land-use and transport planning on long-term city-scale energy intensity in fast-growing city regions. 
				The new modelling framework features a consistent activity-based choice model linking the building and transport sector, subject to explicit time and budget constraints and spatial equilibrium condition in the housing market. The study demonstrates the policy use of the model through an empirical model application for the Greater Beijing in China and estimates the carbon/energy intensity elasticities with respect to planning policy variables with the base-year model after calibration. The calibrated model will then be used to estimate the emission/energy outlook based on a series of urban spatial development scenarios and to test the magnitude and rate of technological and behavioural change required for achieving local sustainability goals.

				<h3>Examine the Spatial Economic Impact of Singapore’s Ethnicity Integration Policy</h3>
				<h4>Shantong Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The study aims to quantitatively assess the spatial and economic impact of Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) on the development of housing market and urban spatial structure in Singapore. 
				Specifically, two main research questions are proposed. (1) Whether EIP would have an impact on the spatial pattern and time-series changes of housing price in Singapore? If so, how would EIP affect the development of urban spatial structure in Singapore through its impact on the housing market?
				(2) How to mitigate/enhance the negative/positive impact of EIP in relation to the 2030 planning goals in Singapore? 
				The research design includes three main work packages, population synthesis, modelling residential location choice under housing market equilibrium and policy scenario analysis.</p>

				<h3>Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Identify Planning Strategies from Government Documents</h3>
				<h4>Emily Tianyuan Wang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Inter-city development disparity is a salient issue for both developed and developing countries. A causal determination of whether and to what extent variations in planning policies lead to different outcomes remains an onerous analytical challenge. 
				Quantitative modelling of such causality requires the identification of a bundle of planning strategies from text-based planning documents in a holistic and temporally consistent manner such that the evolution of development outcomes could be investigated in relation to planning policy changes over time. 
				Enabled by recent progress in natural language processing (NLP), this paper presents a novel NLP application for identifying key planning strategies from a large amount of text-based government documents through a case study of 117 prefecture-level cities in China. 
				Based on official, city-level government reports from 2011 to 2019, the evolving policy strategies are identified and linked with the change of development outcome. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

				<h3>An interdisciplinary method for generating large-scale longitudinal urban expansion data using night-time light data – A case study of 600+ Chinese cities</h3>
				<h4>Zengquan Li</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Night-time light (NTL) data provide a novel and accessible source for monitoring the Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion. The static thresholds ignore the path-dependent nature of urban development. Using NTL data for 2012-2018, this study proposes a new method using dynamic threshold (DT) for extracting UBA using NTL data for 600+ Chinese cities. 
				The dynamic thresholds explicitly address the temporal continuity of urban physical development and further consider intra-city heterogeneity in terms of NTL brightness change pattern. 
				Through a comparison with official statistics in China and UN-Habitat Sentinel-2 Human Settlement data, it is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of the DT method exceeds 85%, and the Kappa index exceeds 0.45. </p>

				<h3>Understanding the Implications of Electric Vehicles on Car Dependence and Public Transport - an Inter-Sectoral Approach</h3>
				<h4>Hao Zhang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The Charging Infrastructure (CI) enables large uptakes of Electric Vehicle (EV) for transport decarbonisation. However, the large adoption of EVs may cause congestions. For sustainable mobility, it is timely important to incorporate congestion control when promoting EVs. Smart placement and operation of CIs should be applied to tackle congestion issues by proactively intervening traffic and driving behaviours for the more EV transport system. CI planning should be considered with the public transport while car dependency can be influenced by economic factors such as charging prices. The research question is how adaptive and inter-sectoral EV charging policies may help mitigate car dependence and complement public transport by spatial and technical configuration of CIs and the associated pricing mechanism. Parameters of traffic, parking, demography and public transport will be incorporated with spatial analysis, while the feasibility of employing dynamic and adaptive charging pricing to influence travel behaviour will be explored.</p>

				<h3>The Reshaped Urban Recreational Space in the Digital Era: Trends, Characteristics, and Responses</h3>
				<h4>Enjia Zhang</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The growing penetration of ICT has redefined recreational activities and changed the demand, choice, and location of urban recreational services. As the Chinese proverb goes, “fragrant wine would not be restricted by deep alleys,” ICT has alleviated many restrictions imposed by conventional locations on people’s spatial preference for leisure activities, enabling new forms and levels of functional integration. Under the influence of ICT, urban recreational service space has been spreading to the urban suburbs and further penetrating the urban two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces such as residential and office areas. In this context, urban mixed-use development evolves from block scale to the building scale and from ground level to ground above level, resulting in the need for new policies and regulations. Therefore, this study aims to measure the penetration degree of recreational service, identify the characteristics of the built environment elements, and explore urban planning and real estate policy by referring to international case studies. The findings could enhance the theory of mixed-use development and compact city in the digital era, and contribute to policymaking for managing and re-purposing urban spaces, especially for high-density cities.</p>

			<h4>Jerry Chen and Li Wan (2023)</h4>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Causality between the built environment and subjective wellbeing has thus far been segmentally explored and partially quantified. We identify two unresolved challenges in the literature. Firstly, a reliance on cross-sectional data produces associative findings. Secondly, a reductive approach to regress aggregate subjective wellbeing on limited and disparate built environment measurements risks significant confounding effects. We address the research gaps by leveraging residential relocation as a natural experiment to investigate the causality between built environment change and subjective wellbeing (measured with composite score of negatively phrased General Health Questionnaire-12 items). Two causal inference methods (difference-in-differences and synthetic control) are applied and compared. The use of the ‘Understanding Society’ dataset (The UK Household Longitudinal Study, 2009-2019), combined with holistic locational attributes (Area Classification at the Lower Super Output Area level as per the UK Census) for exploring such causality is novel in literature. Specifically, to estimate the wellbeing effects of residential relocation, we compare movers (treatment n=773) to non-movers (control n=4,619). To estimate the effects of built environment change, we compare movers with a change of built environment type (n=506) to those moving into the same built environment type (n=267). Our research design incorporates novel extensions to the canonical forms of both causal inference methods – staggered difference-in-differences and generalised synthetic control methods – to accommodate individual-level data with multiple relocation timepoints.</p>

					<h4>Oct 2025</h4>

						<p style="text-align:justify;"> Dr. Li Wan and Byron Huang have recently published a paper. Despite a marked decline in overall travel demand in Great Britain, some cities are experiencing unabated, if not worsened, traffic congestion. This study aims to investigate this paradox of post-pandemic travel through an in-depth case study of Cambridge, a city with a high proportion of highly-skilled professional employment in the UK. Using longitudinal traffic counts and car journey time data, we compare intra-day and intra-week travel demand patterns across four distinct periods between 2019 and 2024, controlling for monthly variation, school and university term, bank holidays, major public events, roadworks, traffic accidents and weather. Our model-based analysis finds that recent car and cycle demand in Cambridge remains at 11.6% and 15.8% below pre-pandemic levels, respectively, but the demand recovery has stabilised since 2022. Despite the overall reduction in travel demand, daily average journey time on key transport corridors in Cambridge has increased by 12.0% from 2022 to 2024, exemplifying the paradox of post-pandemic travel... &nbsp<u>[Read the full paper]</p></a>

						<p style="text-align:justify;"> PhD Candidate Emily Tianyuan Wang, Dr. Jerry Chen, Dr. Zhenyun Deng, and Dr. Li Wan have recently published a paper. Identifying policy topics from lengthy text documents such as official reports is an important analytical task for policy evaluation purposes; yet it is a time-consuming process if done manually. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as BERT model and other emerging LLMs have demonstrated the capability to capture semantic meanings within sentences. However, BERT-based models require substantial expert-labelled training data for fine-tuning for optimal performance, whereas off-the-shelf LLMs provide greater flexibility but tend to overgeneralise. This paper aims to (1) demonstrate three NLP/LLMs methods (fine-tuned BERT, with 10,000 manually labelled sentences; standard GPT-4o; and GPT-4o with in-context learning, with five example sentences provided for each policy domain) for identifying planning policies from planning documents at sentence level and (2) assess the accuracy of NLP/LLMs in policy identification... &nbsp<u>[Read the full paper]</p></a>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">PhD Candidate Qiancheng Wang and Dr. Li Wan have recently published a paper. Understanding the operations of cities and informing policymaking through simulating urban change processes has been a long-lasting endeavour of generations of urban modellers. Digital twins, as an emerging technology originated in engineering and manufacturing, features a simulation process that amalgamates information from various, real-time sources to construct a virtual representation of physical products or systems. One particular urban modelling challenge is to capture the transformative yet nuanced changes of activity patterns at the individual level and understand the associated wider impacts at the city level such that pre-emptive measures could be considered... &nbsp<u>[Read the full paper]</p></a>

						<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Li Wan has recently published a paper: City digital twins (CDTs), as digital replica of urban systems and development processes, have been heralded as the next-generation technology for urban planning and management. Arguably, the concept of CDTs is not new. Prior to CDTs, applied urban modelling has been playing a pivot role in supporting city and infrastructure planning since the 1960s. Examining CDTs in relation to conventional urban models can thus offer valuable insights into their nature, potential, and challenges. Such a comparative, reflective exercise, however, remains rare. This commentary aims to share insights and reflections from a dedicated applied urban modelling (AUM) community. &nbsp<u>[Read the full paper]</p></a>

					    <p style="text-align:justify;">This paper presents a spatio-temporal framework for conceptualising and measuring working flexibility. We argue that the transition from conventional working model towards flexible working is not a simple change of workplace or working schedule, but involves transitions between latent, distinct lifestyles which can be empirically identified. The lifestyle choices are characterised by complex trade-offs between locational and time choices at both inter- and intra-day scales. The framework enables targeted and post-pandemic relevant categorisation of working patterns beyond the trichotomy of home-based, office-based and hybrid working... &nbsp<u>[Read more]</p></a>

					<h4>2023 Highlight</h4>
					<!-- <p style="text-align:justify;"></p> -->
					<a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/book/10.1680/dtsc.66007">
						<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Li Wan has recently got this new book published: Originated from manufacturing and aerospace engineering, the concept of ‘digital twin’ has been celebrated as the next-generation smart city technology, with a number of high-profile applications emerging across the globe. By employing a socio-technical framework, this book critically examines the limitations and potential risks of deploying ‘digital twins’ as a generic technology to cities, and calls for a socio-technical perspective for conceptualising, developing, evaluating and governing city digital twins. The book provides both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for supporting the development of city digital twins. &nbsp<u>[Read more]</u></p>
